// You've intercepted an encrypted message, and you are really curious about its contents. 
// You were able to find out that the message initially contained only lowercase English letters, 
// and was encrypted with the following cipher:

// Let all letters from 'a' to 'z' correspond to the numbers from 0 to 25, respectively.
// The number corresponding to the ith letter of the encrypted message is then equal to the sum 
// of numbers corresponding to the first i letters of the initial unencrypted message modulo 26.
// Now that you know how the message was encrypted, implement the algorithm to decipher it.
