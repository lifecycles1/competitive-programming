# A nonogram is also known as Paint by Numbers and Japanese Crossword. The aim in this puzzle is to 
# color the grid into black and white squares. At the top of each column, and at the side of each row, 
# there are sets of one or more numbers which describe the runs of black squares in that row/column in 
# exact order. For example, if you see 10 1 along some column/row, this indicates that there will be a 
# run of exactly ten black squares, followed by one or more white squares, followed by a single black 
# square. The cells along the edges of the grid can also be white.

# You are given a square nonogram of size size. Its grid is given as a square matrix nonogramField of 
# size (size + 1) / 2 + size, where the first (size + 1) / 2 cells of each row and and each column 
# define the numbers for the corresponding row/column, and the rest size Ã— size cells define the the 
# grid itself.

# Determine if the given nonogram has been solved correctly.

# Note: here / means integer division.

# Example

# For size = 5 and

# nonogramField = [["-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-"],
#                  ["-", "-", "-", "2", "2", "1", "-", "1"],
#                  ["-", "-", "-", "2", "1", "1", "3", "3"],
#                  ["-", "3", "1", "#", "#", "#", ".", "#"],
#                  ["-", "-", "2", "#", "#", ".", ".", "."],
#                  ["-", "-", "2", ".", ".", ".", "#", "#"],
#                  ["-", "1", "2", "#", ".", ".", "#", "#"],
#                  ["-", "-", "5", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"]]
# the output should be solution(size, nonogramField) = true;

# For size = 5 and

# nonogramField = [["-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-"],
#                  ["-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "1", "-", "-"],
#                  ["-", "-", "-", "3", "3", "2", "5", "5"],
#                  ["-", "-", "3", ".", ".", ".", "#", "#"],
#                  ["-", "2", "2", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"],
#                  ["-", "-", "5", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"],
#                  ["-", "-", "5", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"],
#                  ["-", "-", "2", ".", ".", ".", "#", "#"]]
# the output should be solution(size, nonogramField) = false.

# There are three mistakes in the nonogram:

# In the 5th (1-based) row there are numbers ["-", "2", "2"], so there should be two runs of 2 black 
# squares separated by at least one white square. However, there is only one run of 5 black squares.
# In the 6th column there are numbers ["-", "1", "2"], so there should be a run of exactly 1 black square, 
# followed by one or more white squares, followed by another 2 black squares. However, there is a single 
# run of 3 black squares not separated by white ones.
# Finally, in the 4th row there are numbers ["-", "-", "3"], so there should be a single run of exactly 
# 3 black squares. However, there is just a 2-square run in that row.
