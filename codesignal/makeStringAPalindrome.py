# // One way to calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted to make a given string x a palindrome is by using a technique called dynamic programming.

# // Here's a rough outline of how the algorithm works:

# // Create a 2-dimensional array dp of size (n+1)x(n+1), where n is the length of the string x. This array will be used to store the minimum number of insertions required to make the substring x[i...j] a palindrome.

# // Initialize the array by filling the diagonal with zeroes (dp[i][i] = 0) and the rest of the array with a large number (e.g. infinity).

# // Loop through the array and fill in each cell by checking the following conditions:
# // a. if x[i] == x[j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]
# // b. if x[i] != x[j], then dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j])

# // The minimum number of insertions required to make the string x a palindrome is stored in dp[0][n-1]

# // The above algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity and O(n^2) space complexity. The idea is to use the symmetry of a palindrome and the idea of subproblems, where a given substring is checked if it is a palindrome or not and the insertion count is found.

# // Here is an example in javascript that implements the above algorithm:

# function minInsertions(x) {
#   var n = x.length;
#   var dp = new Array(n + 1);
#   for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
#     dp[i] = new Array(n + 1);
#   }
#   for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
#     for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
#       dp[i][j] = Infinity;
#     }
#   }
#   for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
#     dp[i][i] = 0;
#   }
#   for (let len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
#     for (let i = 0; i < n - len + 1; i++) {
#       let j = i + len - 1;
#       if (x[i] == x[j]) {
#         dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
#       } else {
#         dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i + 1][j]);
#       }
#     }
#   }
#   return dp[0][n - 1];
# }
# // You can test the function by calling minInsertions("example") and it should return 2 as "eaxae" is the closest palindrome

# // This is one of the ways you can achieve the task, there are other methods and variations on this algorithm that you can use, depending on the specific requirements of your problem.
