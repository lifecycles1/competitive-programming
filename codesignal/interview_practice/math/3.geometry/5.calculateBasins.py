# A group of farmers has some elevation data that we are going to use to help them understand how 
# rainfall flows over their farmland. We represent the farmland as a 2D array of altitudes, 
# the grid, and use the following model, based on the fact that water flows downhill:

# If a cell's four neighboring cells all have altitudes not lower that its own, this cell is a 
# sink in which water collects.
# Otherwise, water will flow into the neighboring cell with the lowest altitude. If a cell is 
# not a sink, you can assume it has a unique lowest neighbor and that this neighbor will be lower 
# than the cell.
# Cells that drain into the same sink, directly or indirectly, are part of the same basin.
# Given an n Ã— n grid of elevations, your goal is to partition the map into basins and output 
# the sizes of the basins, in descending order.
