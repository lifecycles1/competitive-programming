// In chess, queens can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
// You have an n Ã— n chessboard with some queens on it. You are given several queries, each of
// which represents one square on the chessboard. For each query square, determine whether it
// can be attacked by a queen or not.
