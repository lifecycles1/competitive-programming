// A group of farmers has some elevation data that we are going to use to help them understand how 
// rainfall flows over their farmland. We represent the farmland as a 2D array of altitudes, 
// the grid, and use the following model, based on the fact that water flows downhill:

// If a cell's four neighboring cells all have altitudes not lower that its own, this cell is a 
// sink in which water collects.
// Otherwise, water will flow into the neighboring cell with the lowest altitude. If a cell is 
// not a sink, you can assume it has a unique lowest neighbor and that this neighbor will be lower 
// than the cell.
// Cells that drain into the same sink, directly or indirectly, are part of the same basin.
// Given an n Ã— n grid of elevations, your goal is to partition the map into basins and output 
// the sizes of the basins, in descending order.
