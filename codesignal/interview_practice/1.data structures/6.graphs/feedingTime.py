### COLORING GRAPH PROBLEM ### with 2 python and 1 JavaScript solutions


# You are the head zookeeper at a large zoo. You've been contacted by schools in the area that want to 
# bring in classes so that students can feed the animals. The animals can only be fed once a day, so no 
# two classes can come on the same day if they want to feed the same animals.

# You have a list classes, such that classes[i] is a list of animals that the ith class wants to feed. 
# Classes i and j cannot come on the same day if an animal in classes[i] also appears in classes[j] 
# (for i â‰  j). Your job is to determine the minimum number of days you would need to have all the classes 
# come to feed the animals if they can all come within 5 days. If it isn't possible for all the classes 
# to come within 5 days, return -1 instead.

# Example

# For classes = [["Tiger", "Lima", "Frog"], ["Tiger", "Zebra","Lion"], ["Tiger", "Rabbit"], 
# ["Emu", "Zebra", "Rabbit"]], the output should be

# solution(classes) = 3.

# Classes 0, 1, and 2 all want to feed the Tiger, so they have to come on different days. Class 3 cannot 
# come on the same day as class 1 (because of the Zebra) or class 2 (because of the Rabbit), but they can 
# come on the same day as class 0. Therefore it only takes 3 days for all the classes to visit the zoo.




# Vies this as coloring graph problem. Use brute-force backtracking algorithm.
# We have 5 colors available for each vertex. We try coloring current vertex
# in the 1st available color. Then we try to color every of its uncolored neighbor.
# If we cannot color some neighbor, it means, we have to try different color
# for current vertex. If we have colored all of its neighbors, we return True,
# meaning that graph has been colored succesfully. Else if we tried all colors
# and didn't manage to color the graph, we return False, meaning that graph
# cannot be colored using 5 colors.
# Also when we run coloring dfs function, we need to run it for every uncolored
# vertex, since graph can be disconnected, i.e. after running dfs we only color
# one connected component that has current vertex and not the whole graph.
